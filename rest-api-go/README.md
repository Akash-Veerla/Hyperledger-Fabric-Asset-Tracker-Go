# Asset Tracker REST API

## Overview

This REST API provides a way to interact with the `asset-tracker` Hyperledger Fabric smart contract. It is intended to be run as part of the `docker-compose` setup in the root of the project.

## Configuration

The API is configured via the `config.json` file in this directory. This file is automatically generated by the `scripts/setup-backend.sh` script.

The configuration includes paths to the crypto material, network endpoints, and channel information.

## Running the API

The recommended way to run this API is through the main `docker-compose.yaml` file in the root of the project.

```bash
# From the project root
docker-compose up --build rest-api
```

This will build the Docker image and start the container. The service is also started as part of the full stack `docker-compose up` command.
